## Experience

### **Apple Inc., Pittsburgh, PA --- 2011--2025** 

#### Machine Learning Manager, Services, June 2024â€”August 2025

Manager of Apple News algorithms design team. Our team of scientist-engineers
develop algorithmic aspects of the user experience in News and Stocks, such as:
on-device personalization, semantic understanding of text, deduplication of 
same-fact news stories. We collaborate at the intersection of technology and
liberal arts, working with designers, journalists, app engineers, and backend 
operations engineers.

#### Machine Learning Engineer, Services, January 2014

Founding member of Apple News algorithms team starting 2014. Designed
and built entity linking and other algorithms to assign articles into
topic feeds in reader app. Supervised bring-up of other algorithms such
as clustering of articles and integration of heterogenous topic
taxonomies into knowledge base. Collaborator and catalyst for other
components including search and personalization. Continuous iteration on
accuracy of algorithms, expanding to Stocks app (2018) and French
(2019). Leader when assessing scope and deciding priorities. Good
intuition for fitting work to schedules.

Influential in maintaining a culture of transparency and accountability
via metrics and education. Advocate for demystifying our work and
maintaining close partnership with nontechnical teams such as editorial
and program management. Adapted ambient engineering culture to research
team. Vocal advocate for process changes. Generous with onboarding and
mentoring. Many positive comments in peer and manager feedback.

#### Software Engineer, Productivity Applications, July 2011

Developed iOS and macOS iBooks Author software for authoring and reading multi-touch
books. Wrote Objective-C code, performed code reviews, and collaborated
with other internal groups through three release cycles including the
initial release of multi-touch features in January 2012. Designed and
pitched novel features and filed one patent application.

### **SDL Language Technologies, Los Angeles, CA --- Oct 2004--July 2011** 

#### Manager, Dec 2010--July 2011 

#### Senior Research Scientist, Jan 2010--July 2011 

#### Research Scientist, July 2005--Jan 2010 

#### Senior Data Engineer, Oct 2004--July 2005

Led the development of the core learning workflows that underpinned
SDL's statistical machine translation product line.
Provided leadership and vision for six years, transforming the workflow
from an academic research project to an internally-facing product. Grew
a team of five direct reports and several collaborators with an exciting
and engaged group culture and consistently high achievement in an Agile
development framework. Successfully implemented a strategy of continuous
integration of new research, enabling rapid commercialization in the
cutting-edge field of machine translation. Contributed key innovations
to enable complete parallelization of every component. Created a novel
meta-workflow platform to unify heterogeneous internal processes,
increasing operational efficiency, and permitting rapid integration of
new capabilities. Built and maintained a close relationship with IT to
integrate decision-making concerning workflow software with the
management of operating systems and capital investments in new hardware.

Made original contributions to the field of statistical machine
translation in the areas of parallel processing, domain adaptation,
decoding with synchronous context-free grammars and integrated language
models, integration of statistical and rule-based components, and
named-entity translation. Co-authored academic conference papers.

Managed and led Professional Services department through an important
transition from manual, error-prone processes to repeatable, scalable
and automated ones. Formed and maintained an interdepartmental
collaboration to gather requirements from Services group and implement
them rapidly in the workflow software.

Served as Principal Investigator for several government projects.

### **Center for Communications Research, Princeton, NJ --- June--Aug 2004**

#### Adjunct Research Staff

Invited to join the Summer Conference on Applied Mathematical Problems.
Performed classified research in cryptology. Successfully combined
mathematical research and software engineering in a highly collaborative
environment.

### **Design Science, Inc., Long Beach, CA --- June 2001--Oct 2004**

#### Product Manager

Managed the release of three mathematical expression typesetting
products for Macintosh. Team included myself and three other developers.
Served as liaison with the Microsoft Office for Mac team.

Collaborated with teammate Robert Miner on math-aware search engine.
Modified Lucene open source document indexer with custom analyzer plugin
to index normalized MathML expressions. Part of [an NSF SBIR
project](https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/145099).
