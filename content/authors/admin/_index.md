My name is Greg Langmead. I am a machine learning manager at [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com), where I work on [Apple News](https://www.apple.com/news/) and Stocks.

I have a Ph.D. in mathematics from Columbia University (2001) where I studied gauge theory, supersymmetry, and four-dimensional topology. My dissertation was titled "[A Supersymmetric Gauge Theory Formulation of the Donaldson Polynomial Invariants](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0210192)."

I also have an M.S. in Logic from the [Philosophy department](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy) at Carnegie Mellon University (2025). My [masters thesis](writing/differential_geometry_in_hott) was about bringing differential geometry into [homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org). I sometimes use theorem proving software such as [Agda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)) and [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io).

Previously I worked at Design Science and SDL Language Weaver.

I'm interested in music and try to find time to practice piano, guitar and sometimes the ukulele. I love learning about the chord progressions used in music and am a frequent visitor to [Theorytab](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab).

My interests include mathematics, physics, software, board games (including their iPad versions), and I pile up video games for iOS, Xbox, PC and Mac and never quite get around to playing them. I do the same with books and movies.
